# Apex-DT-250A-SDR-hack-exploration
Research materials regarding whether or not an Apex DT250A (circa 2008) might be hacked to function as a software defined radio, or even as an entire radio system (i.e. without need for another computer). Includes hi resolution circuit board imagery, pdfs or links to chip datasheets, how to access the debug port and detailed debug port outputs.
